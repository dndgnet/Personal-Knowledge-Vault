      "\n",
      "BC Housing staff use the Legal Services Request Power App to request a variety of legal services, including engaging legal counsel for new DAS project work, indemnity reviews, legal opinions, and litigation matters. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, the Legal Services team has undergone a reorganization, adding several in-house lawyers to better meet corporate needs and reduce reliance on contracted external counsel. As part of this transition to an inhouse lawyer-led model, the team has requested several application enhancements to improve efficiency and support the new department structure. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Objectives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Expanded Service Categories: Addition of new legal service types and sub-questions to reflect lawyer-led work (e.g., litigation support, contract drafting, regulatory compliance, policy review). \n",
      "\n",
      "- Refined Language: Rewording of existing service options and field labels to improve clarity and user experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Enhanced Data Capture: Updates to form logic to collect service-specific metadata for reporting and tracking. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Dashboard Enhancements: Improved metrics, filters, and visualizations to reflect the expanded team structure and support workload distribution between paralegals and lawyers. - \n",
